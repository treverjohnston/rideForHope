Climbs are categorized from 4 (easiest) to beyond category (HC) most difficult.\n                    Map My Ride has added an additional category 5 rating. All climb scores are based on distance, grade/elevation\n                    change, and maximum elevation. The combination of these factors drives all final climb categories\n                    and there is no subjective analysis used in the final scoring of any climb score. All other climbs\n                    that do not meet the criteria for categorization are simply too small to rate and can usually be\n                    crossed easily by bicycle, running or walking. Categorized climb ratings are given by the UCI for\n                    races like the Tour de France and other professional cycling events.
