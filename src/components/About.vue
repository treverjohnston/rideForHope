                <b>Ride For Hope</b> is a charity bicycle event with the firm belief that quality healthcare should be accessible
                to everyone. The event is unique in that the full cost of the ride is completely funded by charitable contributions
                from local sponsors. This allows for 100% of participant fees and donations to go directly to charity. â€‹

                We support the holistic approach to healthcare where true healing focuses not only on symptoms, but the underlying root cause
                of disease. </h6>
